If you build and run it using:
```
% ocamlfind ocamlc -package lwt -package lwt.unix -linkpkg -o server str.cma chatServer.ml srvmain.ml
% ./server
```

It will listen for and accept network connections, but won't do anything with the user's input, or write anything at all.

You need to open another terminal and try `nc localhost 16384`.
